Plan to implement functionality
    1. Table of info on backend
        a. Default information will be provided for one
        b. Other elements will be grabbed from an API request to PokeAPI, then added into an object that is added
    2. Adding a new Pokemon
        a. Get either name or number of pokemon (need logic to prevent none or both)
        b. API request using the name/number
        c. API parsed into an object that can be added
            i. Sprite, Ability and type will have an object as the value, rather than a string
        d. Add/remove entries based on id

Expected object:
{  id: (num) , nickname: (string), level: (num), pokeName: (string), pokeNum: (num), sprite: {object: 2 values (regular, shiny), ability: {Object: unknown number of them} , type: {object: 1 or two types }
